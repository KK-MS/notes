## Cartographer

Cartographer is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations.

  * Cartographer provides an RViz plugin which allows the visualization of submaps, the trajectory, and constraints.
  * Once the environment is sufficiently mapped the map file can be saved and it can be loaded later. This is done with the [map_server](http://wiki.ros.org/map_server) ROS package
