### Notes
* NPLF: Scale for the results
  * “not achieved,” “partially achieved,” “largely achieved” or “fully achieved.”

### Points
* ASPICE assessors use an NPLF scale to rate the degree to which the desired outcome was achieved. According to the scale, the results are either “not achieved,” “partially achieved,” “largely achieved” or “fully achieved.” The assessor assigns an NPLF rating for multiple expected outcomes and uses the aggregate rating to determine the overall capability level of the entire project. OEMs determine what will be considered an acceptable capability level for each project.
