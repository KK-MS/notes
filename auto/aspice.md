### Notes
* NPLF: Scale for the results
  * “not achieved,” “partially achieved,” “largely achieved” or “fully achieved.”

### Points
* Rating scale for Acceptable
  * Step-1: ASPICE assessors use an NPLF scale to rate the degree to which the desired outcome was achieved. According to the scale, the results are either “not achieved,” “partially achieved,” “largely achieved” or “fully achieved.” The assessor assigns an NPLF rating for multiple expected outcomes and uses the aggregate rating to determine the overall capability level of the entire project. OEMs determine what will be considered an acceptable capability level for each project.
  * Step-2: The assessor assigns an NPLF rating for multiple expected outcomes and uses the aggregate rating to determine the overall capability level of the entire project.
  * Step-3: OEMs determine what will be considered an **acceptable** capability level for each project.
* ISO 26262: Achieving ASPICE Capability Level 2 is typical for completing an ISO 26262 functional safety audit.
* LEAN: ASPICE also exemplifies Lean manufacturing principles by fostering an iterative design environment, shortening development cycles and ensuring quality throughout the development process
