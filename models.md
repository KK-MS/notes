Example: Mostly KANO
1. User rating to the model parameter in General. Section: (A). Should be asked before the Produce/App related questions.
2. Do the survey about the app
3. User rating to the model parameters w.r.t to the existing product/functionality (B)
4. User rating to the model parameters as per their requirement to current product/functionality (C)
Note: Parameters of (A), (B) and (C) are same, but the context is different.
 

### SUS (System Usability Scale)
When the Information Technology (IT) department at Intel decided to standardize on a usability inventory, it selected the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS is a 10-item, five-point Likert scale with a weighted scoring range of 0–100 and which has been shown to be a reliable measure of usability. It is anchored with one as Strongly Disagree and five as Strongly Agree.

### UMUX (Usability Metric for User Experience)
This result was not surprising in light of recent
findings. Sauro and Dumas (2009) have demonstrated the utility of
a general ease of use Likert item, and have also shown a promising
alternative in the *Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ)*.
Tedesco and Tullis (2006) found that a single ‘‘Overall this task
was: Very Difficult...Very Easy” Likert item correlated significantly
with usability test performance. This direction motivated further
analysis of SUS surveys and SUS Item 3 with other systems, but
no consistent pattern emerged. In some cases SUS Item 3 correlated most strongly with the final SUS score, and in others it did
not. The idea of reducing an instrument to one general ease of
use item was abandoned. Instead, a new direction was taken –
the development of a concise scale that would more closely conform to the ISO 9241-11 (1998) definition of usability, would
minimize bias and language issues, and would still perform as well
as the baseline it was intended to replace. In this case the baseline
was the updated, internationally-appropriate SUS (with ‘‘cumbersome” clarified as ‘‘awkward”) and the performance goal of total
SUS score to the total score of the new scale was set at a correlation
of 0.80 or better. The resulting instrument is the Usability Metric
for User Experience (UMUX), and this paper outlines the research
and development of this usability component of a more general
user experience measurement model.
