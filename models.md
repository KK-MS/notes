Example: Mostly KANO
1. User rating to the model parameter in General. Section: (A). Should be asked before the Produce/App related questions.
2. Do the survey about the app
3. User rating to the model parameters w.r.t to the existing product/functionality (B)
4. User rating to the model parameters as per their requirement to current product/functionality (C)
Note: Parameters of (A), (B) and (C) are same, but the context is different.
 

### SUS (System Usability Scale)
When the Information Technology (IT) department at Intel decided to standardize on a usability inventory, it selected the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS is a 10-item, five-point Likert scale with a weighted scoring range of 0â€“100 and which has been shown to be a reliable measure of usability. It is anchored with one as Strongly Disagree and five as Strongly Agree.
