## Social media

**Social media is indispensable for Leaders... it has transformed how we connect, collaborate, and learn...!!**
It is essential for CEOs and leaders to have an active presence on social media, not only to act as an ambassador for their business but also to strengthen their own personal brand and to raise their profile as thought leaders within their industry.
With so many social media channels to choose from, it’s important to focus on the right ones like Twitter, Linkedin... while Instagram is more suitable for the fashion and entertainment industry.
Sharing interesting content such as videos increases engagement, and posting strong opinions and sound bites provides an opportunity to humanize the organization and to build a strong connect with the customers.
