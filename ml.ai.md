Today, we are very excited to release DeepSense 6G -- The world's first large-scale real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset, enabling machine/deep learning development and benchmarking for a wide range of communication, sensing, and positioning applications. 

DeepSense 6G comprises more than 1 million co-existing multi-modal sensing and communication data points, including various types of sensors (RGB/depth cameras, radar, LiDAR, GPS RTK, IMU) and various communication systems (such as mmWave, sub-6GHz MIMO, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces), and covering multiple indoor/outdoor communication scenarios (V2I, V2V, drones, robots, pedestrians, conference rooms, etc.). 

To encourage benchmarking, DeepSense 6G also offers task-specific development datasets and leaderboard ranking for some key machine learning tasks/applications in the interplay of communications, sensing, and positioning. 

DeepSense 6G is the result of more than 3 years of hard work by my students Gouranga Charan Tawfik Osman Andrew Hredzak Nikhil Srinivas João Morais Umut Demirhan Shunyao Wu Shuaifeng Jiang Muhammad Alrabeiah Xiaofeng Li Madhav Seth
