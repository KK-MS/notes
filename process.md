# Process

## Agile Scrum 

Share planned sprint stories. You can pick from backlog or add new stories. Share your user-stories in its format:
As an ….. (architect/researcher/developer/tester/), I want to do ….. so that ……

Tips:

•	“So that”: statement should clearly indicate the targeted goal and it can be test/verified.
•	Divide the stories between the design (indication of module, input, expected data) and its development (include testing)
